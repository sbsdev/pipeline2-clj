A Clojure library to interact with the [Pipeline2 Web Service
API](https://daisy.github.io/pipeline/WebServiceAPI).

## Usage

```clojure
(require '[clojure.java.io :as io])
(require '[clojure.data.xml :as xml])

;; list all script supported by the server
(print (xml/indent-str (scripts)))

;; get help for a particular script
(print (xml/indent-str (script "dtbook-to-epub3")))

;; invoke a script.
;; `with-job` will take care of releasing any resources after completion
(with-job [job (job-create "sbs:dtbook-to-ebook" {:source "book.xml"} {})]
  (let [results (get-results (dp2/wait-for-result job))
        epub-stream (->> results
                         (filter #(string/ends-with? % ".epub"))
                         first
                         get-stream)]
    (with-open [in epub-stream
                out (io/output-stream "book.epub")]
      (io/copy in out))))
```
